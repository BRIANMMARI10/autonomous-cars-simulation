# Self-Driving Car Simulation: Path Planning and Camera Enhancements

This project builds on the repository [ENPM661 Project 5](https://github.com/BrianBock/ENPM661-Project-5), which implements various path-planning algorithms for a self-driving car, including:
- **RRT** (Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree)
- **A\*** (A-Star)
- **Dijkstra**
- **BFS** (Breadth-First Search)
- **DFS** (Depth-First Search)

## My Contributions
- **Sky View Mode**:
  - Added a new camera mode that provides a fixed, bird's-eye view of the entire track for better visualization of simulations.
  
- **Algorithm Simulations**:
  - Ran extensive simulations for grid-based planners (A*, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS) to evaluate their performance across different difficulty levels.

- **Performance Improvements**:
  - Optimized runtime and memory usage for A* and Dijkstra planners by improving priority queue handling.
  - Improved overall efficiency for grid-based algorithms.
