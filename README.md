# ENPM661 Project 5 (Self-driving Car)      			             
This project implements RRT trajectory planning for a car (non-holonomic robot) with steering as the only control input.  
A\*, Dijkstra, BFS and DFS search algorithms are also supported.

## Setup
1. Run the following command in the terminal: `python autopilot.py`

## TODO
Fix nearest neighbor function where it sometimes doesn't pick the closest node.

## Dependencies
    numpy
    cv2
    pickle
    random
    matplotlib
    collections
    heapq
    time
